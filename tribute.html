        <h3><b>HERE IS SOME GLIMPSE OF HER LIFE </b></h3>
        <div class = "Jhaansi">
            <ul type = "circle">
                <li> Rani Lakshmi Bai was the queen of the princely state of Jhansi, which is located on the northern side of India. She was one of the most leading personalities of the first war of India’s independence that started in 1857</li>
                <h2> Early life of Jhaansi ki Rani</h2>
                <li>She was born to a Maharashtrian family at Kashi (now Varanasi) in the year 18 November 1835. During her childhood, she was called by the name Manikarnika.
                    While pursuing studies, she also took formal training in martial arts, which included horse riding, shooting and fencing. 
                    In the year 1842, she got married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Raja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. On getting married, she was given the name Lakshmi Bai
                    In the year 1853, Gangadhar Rao fell sick and became very weak. So, the couple decided to adopt a child. To ensure that the British do not raise an issue over the adoption, Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai got this adoption witnessed by the local British representatives. On 21st November 1853, Maharaja Gangadhar Rao died. </li><br>
                    <h2> 'Meri Jhaansi Nahi Dungi '</h2>
                    <li>On 7th March 1854, the British issued a gazette dissolving the State of Jhansi. Rani Lakshmibai was enraged due to the injustice when an English officer, Major Ellis came to meet Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai. He read out the official declaration dissolving the State. The furious Rani Lakshmibai told Ellis ‘‘Meri Jhansi Nahin Doongi (I shall not part with my Jhansi)’ when he sought her permission to leave. Ellis heard her and left. Battle of 1857 The battle for freedom that started from January 1857 engulfed even Meerut on 10th May.
                        The soldiers started looting people. Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai decided to join Peshava by breaking the bloc of the enemy. In the night, with her troupe of trusted 200 cavalry, she tied her 12 year old son Damodar to her back and raising the slogan of ‘Jai Shankar’ left her fort. She penetrated the British bloc and rode towards Kalpi. Her father Moropant was with her. While breaking the faction of the British army, her father got injured, was captured by the British and was hanged.</li><br>
                        <h2>Sacrifice Of Life On The Alter Of Freedom</h2>
                        <li>On 18th June, the British attacked Gwalior from all sides. She decided to break the enemy front and go out rather than surrendering. While breaking the military front, she came across a garden. She was not riding her ‘Rajratan’ horse. The new horse started going round and round near a canal instead of jumping and crossing it. Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai realized the consequences and turned back to attack the British army. She got injured, started bleeding and fell from her horse. Being in a man’s costume, the soldiers did not recognize her and left her there. The faithful servants of Rani took her to a nearby Gangadas Mutt and gave her Gangajal. She expressed her last wish that her body should not be touched by any British men and embraced a brave death. The revolutionaries all over the world, the organization of Sardar Bhagat Singh and in the end even the army of Netaji Subhashchandra Bose were inspired by the valour shown by Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai. The Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai breathed her last at the young age of 23 years.

                        </li><br>
                        She inspired many generations of Hindustani’s, thus becoming immortal in the freedom fight. We bow before such a brave warrior, the Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai. The life history of the Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai, who preferred to sacrifice her life at the young age of 23 years in battle, is very inspiring. She surprised the British by showing extraordinary fighting spirit and valour in battles fought at Jhansi, then Kalpi and lastly at Gwalior. The British Major Sir Hugh Rose had to come down to treachery so as to be able to win over the fort of Jhansi. Such an extraordinary lady, who tied her son on her back while fighting the battle, will not be found in the history of the world. The valour and brave death she chose, which gave inspiration to the patriots belonging to the ‘Gadar’ party in the First World War, the organization of Shahid Bhagat Singh and to all revolutionaries from Swatatntryaveer Savarkar to Subhashchandra, is magnificent. Lot of literature has been written on the life history of Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai. Heroic poems have been composed in her honor.

                        <h2>Unknown qualities of ‘Ranaragini Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai’ !</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <h2> Childhood</h2>
                            <li>Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai was the only daughter of Shri. Moropant Tambe, employed with Shrimant Bajirao Peshave. She lost her mother when she was quite young; therefore, Moropant tried to train her in everything. Later, she was married to Raje Gangadharbaba of Jhansi ‘sansthan (small State)’ and her name was changed to Lakshmibai.</li>
                            <H2>Rani abiding by Dharma</H2>
                            <LI>After the death of Raje Gangadharbaba, management of his ‘sansthan’ was taken over by the British. After her husband’s death, Rani wanted to go to Sri Kshetra Prayag for shaving her head; but permission of the British was required for the same which was being delayed. Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai, therefore, observed a rule that till she could shave off her head, she would smear ‘Bhasma’ after bath and make offering of Rs.3/- to 3 Brahmins every day. Accordingly, Rani used to get up early and finish her bath etc. and wearing a white sari, she used to perform ‘puja’ of ‘Parthiv Linga (linga made of soil)’ every day after ‘Tulsi-puja’.</LI>
                            <H2>Regular physical exercises</H2>
                            <LI>Lakshmibai liked to exercise right from her childhood and to go for horse-ride regularly. Even after becoming a queen of Jhansi, she used to get up early and did exercises. Then she used to go for horse-ride followed with a ride on elephant. This was her routine.</LI>
                            <H2>Good judge of horses</H2>
                            <LI>Rani Lakshmibai was a good judge of horses. She was known for her knowledge of horses. Once a horse-seller went to King Babasaheb Apate of Sri Kshetra Ujjain with two good horses; but he could not judge them. Then the seller went to Shrimant Jayajiraje Shinde of Gwalior; but he too was unable to make out the quality of horses. Finally, he came to Jhansi. Rani Lakshmibai had a ride on one horse and told the seller that the horse was of good-bred and offered Rs. 1200/- to him. Then she rode the other horse and offered him only Rs. 50/- for the same; telling that the horse had hurt its chest. The seller accepted the facts. Those, who had examined the horses earlier, had said that both the horses were of equal strength.</LI>
                            <H2>Brave Jhansi ki Rani, faces death while fighting !</H2>
                            <li>Shrimant Nanasaheb Peshave, Tatya Tope and Rani Lakshmibai won over Gwalior; but Jayajiraje Shinde, who had run away, took help of the British and attacked again. At Gwalior, a battle was fought during which Rani was hit with a bullet; but in that condition also, she kept on fighting. Finally, she was hit with sword and fell from her horse; but Tatya Tope immediately took her body and broke the siege. He cremated her and did last rites. Thus, Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai, who fought for her Dharma, is known even today as a brave queen as ‘Khub Ladi Mardani, woh to Jhanisiwali Rani Thi !’
